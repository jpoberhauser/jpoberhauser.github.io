Welcome to this collection of posts and tutorials.

There are some posts that show important Deep Learning paper summaries, others showcase cool python libraries, and others will help you get started in Computer Vision and Object Dectection. 


I currently work as a Data Scientist building Deep Learning models used for weapon detection systems using Computer Vision.
