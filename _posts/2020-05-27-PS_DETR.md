# Paper Summary: End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers

## Abstract

New approach to object detection that performs end-to-end object detection as a **direct set prediction problem**. This approach streamlines the detection pipeline, and removes the need for some postprocessing techniques used in other detection methods. These post (and pre) processing steps include NMS and anchors/proposal generation.
